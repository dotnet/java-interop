		string activityJavaDoc = @"An activity is a single, focused thing that the user can do.  Almost all
  activities interact with the user, so the Activity class takes care of
  creating a window for you in which you can place your UI with
  {@link #setContentView}.  While activities are often presented to the user
  as full-screen windows, they can also be used in other ways: as floating
  windows (via a theme with {@link android.R.attr#windowIsFloating} set),
  <a href=""https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/ui/multi-window"">
  Multi-Window mode</a> or embedded into other windows.
  
  There are two methods almost all subclasses of Activity will implement:
  
  <ul>
      <li> {@link #onCreate} is where you initialize your activity.  Most
      importantly, here you will usually call {@link #setContentView(int)}
      with a layout resource defining your UI, and using {@link #findViewById}
      to retrieve the widgets in that UI that you need to interact with
      programmatically.
  
      <li> {@link #onPause} is where you deal with the user pausing active
      interaction with the activity. Any changes made by the user should at
      this point be committed (usually to the
      {@link android.content.ContentProvider} holding the data). In this
      state the activity is still visible on screen.
  </ul>
  
  <p>To be of use with {@link android.content.Context#startActivity Context.startActivity()}, all
  activity classes must have a corresponding
  {@link android.R.styleable#AndroidManifestActivity &lt;activity&gt;}
  declaration in their package's <code>AndroidManifest.xml</code>.</p>

  <h3>Developer Guides</h3>
  <p>The Activity class is an important part of an application's overall lifecycle,
  and the way activities are launched and put together is a fundamental
  part of the platform's application model. For a detailed perspective on the structure of an
  Android application and how activities behave, please read the
  <a href=""{@docRoot}guide/topics/fundamentals.html"">Application Fundamentals</a> and
  <a href=""{@docRoot}guide/components/tasks-and-back-stack.html"">Tasks and Back Stack</a>

  <h3>Fragments</h3>
  
  <p>The {@link androidx.fragment.app.FragmentActivity} subclass
  can make use of the {@link androidx.fragment.app.Fragment} class to better
  modularize their code, build more sophisticated user interfaces for larger
  screens, and help scale their application between small and large screens.</p>
  
  <p>For more information about using fragments, read the
  <a href=""{@docRoot}guide/components/fragments.html"">Fragments</a> developer guide.</p>
  
  <a name=""ActivityLifecycle""></a>
  <h3>Activity Lifecycle</h3>
  
  <p>Activities in the system are managed as
  <a href=""https://developer.android.com/guide/components/activities/tasks-and-back-stack"">
  activity stacks</a>. When a new activity is started, it is usually placed on the top of the
  current stack and becomes the running activity -- the previous activity always remains
  below it in the stack, and will not come to the foreground again until
  the new activity exits. There can be one or multiple activity stacks visible
  on screen.</p>
  
  <p>An activity has essentially four states:</p>
  <ul>
      <li>If an activity is in the foreground of the screen (at the highest position of the topmost
          stack), it is <em>active</em> or <em>running</em>. This is usually the activity that the
          user is currently interacting with.</li>
      <li>If an activity has lost focus but is still presented to the user, it is <em>visible</em>.
          It is possible if a new non-full-sized or transparent activity has focus on top of your
          activity, another activity has higher position in multi-window mode, or the activity
          itself is not focusable in current windowing mode. Such activity is completely alive (it
          maintains all state and member information and remains attached to the window manager).
      <li>If an activity is completely obscured by another activity,
          it is <em>stopped</em> or <em>hidden</em>. It still retains all state and member
          information, however, it is no longer visible to the user so its window is hidden
          and it will often be killed by the system when memory is needed elsewhere.</li>
      <li>The system can drop the activity from memory by either asking it to finish,
          or simply killing its process, making it <em>destroyed</em>. When it is displayed again
          to the user, it must be completely restarted and restored to its previous state.</li>
  </ul>
  
  <p>The following diagram shows the important state paths of an Activity.
  The square rectangles represent callback methods you can implement to
  perform operations when the Activity moves between states.  The colored
  ovals are major states the Activity can be in.</p>
  
  <p><img src=""../../../images/activity_lifecycle.png""
       alt=""State diagram for an Android Activity Lifecycle."" border=""0"" /></p>
  
  <p>There are three key loops you may be interested in monitoring within your
  activity:
  
  <ul>
  <li>The <b>entire lifetime</b> of an activity happens between the first call
  to {@link android.app.Activity#onCreate} through to a single final call
  to {@link android.app.Activity#onDestroy}.  An activity will do all setup
  of ""global"" state in onCreate(), and release all remaining resources in
  onDestroy().  For example, if it has a thread running in the background
  to download data from the network, it may create that thread in onCreate()
  and then stop the thread in onDestroy().
  
  <li>The <b>visible lifetime</b> of an activity happens between a call to
  {@link android.app.Activity#onStart} until a corresponding call to
  {@link android.app.Activity#onStop}.  During this time the user can see the
  activity on-screen, though it may not be in the foreground and interacting
  with the user.  Between these two methods you can maintain resources that
  are needed to show the activity to the user.  For example, you can register
  a {@link android.content.BroadcastReceiver} in onStart() to monitor for changes
  that impact your UI, and unregister it in onStop() when the user no
  longer sees what you are displaying.  The onStart() and onStop() methods
  can be called multiple times, as the activity becomes visible and hidden
  to the user.
  
  <li>The <b>foreground lifetime</b> of an activity happens between a call to
  {@link android.app.Activity#onResume} until a corresponding call to
  {@link android.app.Activity#onPause}.  During this time the activity is
  in visible, active and interacting with the user.  An activity
  can frequently go between the resumed and paused states -- for example when
  the device goes to sleep, when an activity result is delivered, when a new
  intent is delivered -- so the code in these methods should be fairly
  lightweight.
  </ul>
  
  <p>The entire lifecycle of an activity is defined by the following
  Activity methods.  All of these are hooks that you can override
  to do appropriate work when the activity changes state.  All
  activities will implement {@link android.app.Activity#onCreate}
  to do their initial setup; many will also implement
  {@link android.app.Activity#onPause} to commit changes to data and
  prepare to pause interacting with the user, and {@link android.app.Activity#onStop}
  to handle no longer being visible on screen. You should always
  call up to your superclass when implementing these methods.</p>
  
  </p>

  </table>
  
  <p>Note the ""Killable"" column in the above table -- for those methods that
  are marked as being killable, after that method returns the process hosting the
  activity may be killed by the system <em>at any time</em> without another line
  of its code being executed.  Because of this, you should use the
  {@link #onPause} method to write any persistent data (such as user edits)
  to storage.  In addition, the method
  {@link #onSaveInstanceState(Bundle)} is called before placing the activity
  in such a background state, allowing you to save away any dynamic instance
  state in your activity into the given Bundle, to be later received in
  {@link #onCreate} if the activity needs to be re-created.
  See the <a href=""#ProcessLifecycle"">Process Lifecycle</a>
  section for more information on how the lifecycle of a process is tied
  to the activities it is hosting.  Note that it is important to save
  persistent data in {@link #onPause} instead of {@link #onSaveInstanceState}
  because the latter is not part of the lifecycle callbacks, so will not
  be called in every situation as described in its documentation.</p>
  
  <p class=""note"">Be aware that these semantics will change slightly between
  applications targeting platforms starting with {@link android.os.Build.VERSION_CODES#HONEYCOMB}
  vs. those targeting prior platforms.  Starting with Honeycomb, an application
  is not in the killable state until its {@link #onStop} has returned.  This
  impacts when {@link #onSaveInstanceState(Bundle)} may be called (it may be
  safely called after {@link #onPause()}) and allows an application to safely
  wait until {@link #onStop()} to save persistent state.</p>
  
  <p class=""note"">For applications targeting platforms starting with
  {@link android.os.Build.VERSION_CODES#P} {@link #onSaveInstanceState(Bundle)}
  will always be called after {@link #onStop}, so an application may safely
  perform fragment transactions in {@link #onStop} and will be able to save
  persistent state later.</p>
  
  <p>For those methods that are not marked as being killable, the activity's
  process will not be killed by the system starting from the time the method
  is called and continuing after it returns.  Thus an activity is in the killable
  state, for example, between after <code>onStop()</code> to the start of
  <code>onResume()</code>. Keep in mind that under extreme memory pressure the
  system can kill the application process at any time.</p>
  
  <a name=""ConfigurationChanges""></a>
  <h3>Configuration Changes</h3>
  
  <p>If the configuration of the device (as defined by the
  {@link Configuration Resources.Configuration} class) changes,
  then anything displaying a user interface will need to update to match that
  configuration.  Because Activity is the primary mechanism for interacting
  with the user, it includes special support for handling configuration
  changes.</p>
  
  <p>Unless you specify otherwise, a configuration change (such as a change
  in screen orientation, language, input devices, etc) will cause your
  current activity to be <em>destroyed</em>, going through the normal activity
  lifecycle process of {@link #onPause},
  {@link #onStop}, and {@link #onDestroy} as appropriate.  If the activity
  had been in the foreground or visible to the user, once {@link #onDestroy} is
  called in that instance then a new instance of the activity will be
  created, with whatever savedInstanceState the previous instance had generated
  from {@link #onSaveInstanceState}.</p>
  
  <p>This is done because any application resource,
  including layout files, can change based on any configuration value.  Thus
  the only safe way to handle a configuration change is to re-retrieve all
  resources, including layouts, drawables, and strings.  Because activities
  must already know how to save their state and re-create themselves from
  that state, this is a convenient way to have an activity restart itself
  with a new configuration.</p>
  
  <p>In some special cases, you may want to bypass restarting of your
  activity based on one or more types of configuration changes.  This is
  done with the {@link android.R.attr#configChanges android:configChanges}
  attribute in its manifest.  For any types of configuration changes you say
  that you handle there, you will receive a call to your current activity's
  {@link #onConfigurationChanged} method instead of being restarted.  If
  a configuration change involves any that you do not handle, however, the
  activity will still be restarted and {@link #onConfigurationChanged}
  will not be called.</p>

  <h3>Starting Activities and Getting Results</h3>
  
  <p>The {@link android.app.Activity#startActivity}
  method is used to start a
  new activity, which will be placed at the top of the activity stack.  It
  takes a single argument, an {@link android.content.Intent Intent},
  which describes the activity
  to be executed.</p>
  
  <p>Sometimes you want to get a result back from an activity when it
  ends.  For example, you may start an activity that lets the user pick
  a person in a list of contacts; when it ends, it returns the person
  that was selected.  To do this, you call the
  {@link android.app.Activity#startActivityForResult(Intent, int)}
  version with a second integer parameter identifying the call.  The result
  will come back through your {@link android.app.Activity#onActivityResult}
  method.</p>
  
  <p>When an activity exits, it can call
  {@link android.app.Activity#setResult(int)}
  to return data back to its parent.  It must always supply a result code,
  which can be the standard results RESULT_CANCELED, RESULT_OK, or any
  custom values starting at RESULT_FIRST_USER.  In addition, it can optionally
  return back an Intent containing any additional data it wants.  All of this
  information appears back on the
  parent's <code>Activity.onActivityResult()</code>, along with the integer
  identifier it originally supplied.</p>
  
  <p>If a child activity fails for any reason (such as crashing), the parent
  activity will receive a result with the code RESULT_CANCELED.</p>

  public class MyActivity extends Activity {
      ...
  
      static final int PICK_CONTACT_REQUEST = 0;
  
      public boolean onKeyDown(int keyCode, KeyEvent event) {
          if (keyCode == KeyEvent.KEYCODE_DPAD_CENTER) {
              // When the user center presses, let them pick a contact.
              startActivityForResult(
                  new Intent(Intent.ACTION_PICK,
                  new Uri(""content://contacts"")),
                  PICK_CONTACT_REQUEST);
             return true;
          }
          return false;
      }
  
      protected void onActivityResult(int requestCode, int resultCode,
              Intent data) {
          if (requestCode == PICK_CONTACT_REQUEST) {
              if (resultCode == RESULT_OK) {
                  // A contact was picked.  Here we will just display it
                  // to the user.
                  startActivity(new Intent(Intent.ACTION_VIEW, data));

          }
      }

  <a name=""SavingPersistentState""></a>
  <h3>Saving Persistent State</h3>
  
  <p>There are generally two kinds of persistent state that an activity
  will deal with: shared document-like data (typically stored in a SQLite
  database using a {@linkplain android.content.ContentProvider content provider})
  and internal state such as user preferences.</p>
  
  <p>For content provider data, we suggest that activities use an
  ""edit in place"" user model.  That is, any edits a user makes are effectively
  made immediately without requiring an additional confirmation step.
  Supporting this model is generally a simple matter of following two rules:</p>
  
  <ul>
      <li> <p>When creating a new document, the backing database entry or file for
              it is created immediately.  For example, if the user chooses to write
              a new email, a new entry for that email is created as soon as they
              start entering data, so that if they go to any other activity after
              that point this email will now appear in the list of drafts.</p>
      <li> <p>When an activity's <code>onPause()</code> method is called, it should
              commit to the backing content provider or file any changes the user
              has made.  This ensures that those changes will be seen by any other
              activity that is about to run.  You will probably want to commit
              your data even more aggressively at key times during your
              activity's lifecycle: for example before starting a new
              activity, before finishing your own activity, when the user
              switches between input fields, etc.</p>
  </ul>
  
  <p>This model is designed to prevent data loss when a user is navigating
  between activities, and allows the system to safely kill an activity (because
  system resources are needed somewhere else) at any time after it has been
  stopped (or paused on platform versions before {@link android.os.Build.VERSION_CODES#HONEYCOMB}).
  Note this implies that the user pressing BACK from your activity does <em>not</em>
  mean ""cancel"" -- it means to leave the activity with its current contents
  saved away.  Canceling edits in an activity must be provided through
  some other mechanism, such as an explicit ""revert"" or ""undo"" option.</p>
  
  <p>See the {@linkplain android.content.ContentProvider content package} for
  more information about content providers.  These are a key aspect of how
  different activities invoke and propagate data between themselves.</p>
  
  <p>The Activity class also provides an API for managing internal persistent state
  associated with an activity.  This can be used, for example, to remember
  the user's preferred initial display in a calendar (day view or week view)
  or the user's default home page in a web browser.</p>
  
  <p>Activity persistent state is managed
  with the method {@link #getPreferences},
  allowing you to retrieve and
  modify a set of name/value pairs associated with the activity.  To use
  preferences that are shared across multiple application components
  (activities, receivers, services, providers), you can use the underlying
  {@link Context#getSharedPreferences Context.getSharedPreferences()} method
  to retrieve a preferences
  object stored under a specific name.
  (Note that it is not possible to share settings data across application
  packages -- for that you will need a content provider.)</p>
  
  <p>Here is an excerpt from a calendar activity that stores the user's
  preferred view mode in its persistent settings:</p>
  
  <pre class=""prettyprint"">
  public class CalendarActivity extends Activity {
      ...
  
      static final int DAY_VIEW_MODE = 0;
      static final int WEEK_VIEW_MODE = 1;
  
      private SharedPreferences mPrefs;
      private int mCurViewMode;
  
      protected void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {
          super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);
  
          mPrefs = getSharedPreferences(getLocalClassName(), MODE_PRIVATE);
          mCurViewMode = mPrefs.getInt(""view_mode"", DAY_VIEW_MODE);
      }
  
      protected void onPause() {
          super.onPause();
  
          SharedPreferences.Editor ed = mPrefs.edit();
          ed.putInt(""view_mode"", mCurViewMode);
          ed.commit();
      }
  }
  </pre>
  
  <a name=""Permissions""></a>
  <h3>Permissions</h3>
  
  <p>The ability to start a particular Activity can be enforced when it is
  declared in its
  manifest's {@link android.R.styleable#AndroidManifestActivity &lt;activity&gt;}
  tag.  By doing so, other applications will need to declare a corresponding
  {@link android.R.styleable#AndroidManifestUsesPermission &lt;uses-permission&gt;}
  element in their own manifest to be able to start that activity.
  
  <p>When starting an Activity you can set {@link Intent#FLAG_GRANT_READ_URI_PERMISSION
  Intent.FLAG_GRANT_READ_URI_PERMISSION} and/or {@link Intent#FLAG_GRANT_WRITE_URI_PERMISSION
  Intent.FLAG_GRANT_WRITE_URI_PERMISSION} on the Intent.  This will grant the
  Activity access to the specific URIs in the Intent.  Access will remain
  until the Activity has finished (it will remain across the hosting
  process being killed and other temporary destruction).  As of
  {@link android.os.Build.VERSION_CODES#GINGERBREAD}, if the Activity
  was already created and a new Intent is being delivered to
  {@link #onNewIntent(Intent)}, any newly granted URI permissions will be added
  to the existing ones it holds.
  
  <p>See the <a href=""{@docRoot}guide/topics/security/security.html"">Security and Permissions</a>
  document for more information on permissions and security in general.
  
  <a name=""ProcessLifecycle""></a>
  <h3>Process Lifecycle</h3>
  
  <p>The Android system attempts to keep an application process around for as
  long as possible, but eventually will need to remove old processes when
  memory runs low. As described in <a href=""#ActivityLifecycle"">Activity
  Lifecycle</a>, the decision about which process to remove is intimately
  tied to the state of the user's interaction with it. In general, there
  are four states a process can be in based on the activities running in it,
  listed here in order of importance. The system will kill less important
  processes (the last ones) before it resorts to killing more important
  processes (the first ones).
  
  <ol>
  <li> <p>The <b>foreground activity</b> (the activity at the top of the screen
  that the user is currently interacting with) is considered the most important.
  Its process will only be killed as a last resort, if it uses more memory
  than is available on the device.  Generally at this point the device has
  reached a memory paging state, so this is required in order to keep the user
  interface responsive.
  <li> <p>A <b>visible activity</b> (an activity that is visible to the user
  but not in the foreground, such as one sitting behind a foreground dialog
  or next to other activities in multi-window mode)
  is considered extremely important and will not be killed unless that is
  required to keep the foreground activity running.
  <li> <p>A <b>background activity</b> (an activity that is not visible to
  the user and has been stopped) is no longer critical, so the system may
  safely kill its process to reclaim memory for other foreground or
  visible processes.  If its process needs to be killed, when the user navigates
  back to the activity (making it visible on the screen again), its
  {@link #onCreate} method will be called with the savedInstanceState it had previously
  supplied in {@link #onSaveInstanceState} so that it can restart itself in the same
  state as the user last left it.
  <li> <p>An <b>empty process</b> is one hosting no activities or other
  application components (such as {@link Service} or
  {@link android.content.BroadcastReceiver} classes).  These are killed very
  quickly by the system as memory becomes low.  For this reason, any
  background operation you do outside of an activity must be executed in the
  context of an activity BroadcastReceiver or Service to ensure that the system
  knows it needs to keep your process around.
  </ol>
  
  <p>Sometimes an Activity may need to do a long-running operation that exists
  independently of the activity lifecycle itself.  An example may be a camera
  application that allows you to upload a picture to a web site.  The upload
  may take a long time, and the application should allow the user to leave
  the application while it is executing.  To accomplish this, your Activity
  should start a {@link Service} in which the upload takes place.  This allows
  the system to properly prioritize your process (considering it to be more
  important than other non-visible applications) for the duration of the
  upload, independent of whether the original activity is paused, stopped,
  or finished.
