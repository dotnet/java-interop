# java-source-utils

`java-source-utils` is a Java program which uses [JavaParser][0] to process
Java source code in order to extract method parameter names and Javadoc
documentation, as the typical alternative is to instead process Javadoc *HTML*
to obtain this information, and Javadoc HTML is less "stable" than Java source.
